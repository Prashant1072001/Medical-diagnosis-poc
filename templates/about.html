      <div class="about-content">
        <!-- Content will be pasted here -->
        <p>Welcome to AI for Medical Diagnosis, a web application designed to harness the power of artificial intelligence in diagnosing various medical conditions. Our goal is to provide an accessible and efficient platform for early detection and prediction of diseases, empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their health.</p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
          <!-- Paste the content related to what the app does -->
          At AI for Medical Diagnosis, we focus on leveraging machine learning models to predict and diagnose the following conditions:
            <ul>
                <li>Heart Disease</li>
                <li>Diabetes</li>
                <li>Liver Disease</li>
                <li>Chronic Kidney Disease</li>
                <li>Brease Cancer</li>
                <li>Malaria</li>
            </ul>
          Using advanced algorithms trained on real-world medical data, our models analyze the key features and predict the likelihood of a patient suffering from a specific condition.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          <!-- Paste the content related to how the app works -->
           <ul>
           <li><b>Data Input:</b> The user enters relevant health data (such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.) for the disease model they want to evaluate.</li>
           <li><b>Prediction:</b> Based on the provided data, the model will predict the likelihood of the disease.
           </li>
           <li><b>Results:</b> The system will show the result and suggest preventive measures or the next steps to take, depending on the prediction.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Why Use AI for Medical Diagnosis?</h2>
